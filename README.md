# Prediction model with R
For a school assignment, create, predict, and assess a model in R. We have used data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and did analysis on that. Data could be used from anywhere. For example, use Google dataset search, Kaggle datasets, a dataset from an R package, or something that has been collected ourselves.

## Requirements

* Explain the dataset in 1 or 2 paragraphs
* Use tidyverse
* Clean, legible R code (preferably following something close to the google style guide)
* Explain which method you use (regression/classification and what exactly)
* Assess your predictions
* Interpret the parameters of your method, if applicable
* Make conclusions about your predictions
* Use plots where useful (they are almost always useful)
